#  NobusWare X Grand Theft Auto 5

### Simple Mod Menu (Written in Java)

## Disclamer
This menu is totally in native java, I've always dreamed of doing it in a language familiar to me, the idea of ​​this project was also born to give anyone who is not very familiar with C/C++ to develop in complete comfort in simple language.
For this project of mine I used the following technologies:

- JNA (Java Native Access)
- GDI32 (Rendering Overlay)
